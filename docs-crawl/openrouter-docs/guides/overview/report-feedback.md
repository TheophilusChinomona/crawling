Report Feedback
===============

Copy page

Help us improve OpenRouter by reporting issues with AI generations. You can submit feedback directly from the Chatroom or the Activity page.

Overview
--------

The Report Feedback feature allows you to flag problematic generations with a category and description. This helps our team identify and address issues with model responses, latency, billing, and more.

### Feedback Categories

When reporting feedback, select the category that best describes the issue:

* **Latency**: Response was slower than expected
* **Incoherence**: Response didn’t make sense or was off-topic
* **Incorrect Response**: Response contained factual errors or wrong information
* **Formatting**: Response had formatting issues (markdown, code blocks, etc.)
* **Billing**: Unexpected charges or token counts
* **API Error**: Technical errors or failed requests
* **Other**: Any other issue not covered above

Reporting from the Chatroom
---------------------------

In the Chatroom, you can report feedback on individual assistant messages:

1. Hover over an assistant message to reveal the action buttons
2. Click the bug icon to open the Report Feedback dialog
3. Select a category that describes the issue
4. Add a comment explaining what went wrong
5. Click **Submit** to send your feedback

The generation ID is automatically captured from the message, so you don’t need to look it up.

Reporting from the Activity Page
--------------------------------

The Activity page offers two ways to report feedback:

### Per-Generation Feedback

Each row in your activity history has a feedback button:

1. Go to [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
2. Find the generation you want to report
3. Click the bug icon on that row
4. Select a category and add your comment
5. Click **Submit**

### General Feedback Button

For reporting issues when you have a generation ID handy:

1. Go to [openrouter.ai/activity](https://openrouter.ai/activity)
2. Click the **Report Feedback** button in the header (top right)
3. Enter the generation ID (found in your API response or activity row)
4. Select a category and add your comment
5. Click **Submit**

##### Finding Your Generation ID

The generation ID is returned in the API response under the `id` field. You can also find it by clicking on a row in the Activity page to view the generation details.

What Happens After You Submit
-----------------------------

Your feedback is reviewed by our team to help improve:

* Model routing and provider selection
* Error handling and recovery
* Billing accuracy
* Overall platform reliability

We appreciate your help in making OpenRouter better for everyone.
